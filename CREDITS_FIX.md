# Fix: Insufficient Credits Issue

## Problem Identified ✅
From your terminal output:
```
🔄 User credits: 0
```

**You have 0 credits!** The workflow system requires credits to execute automations.

## Why This Happened
- You started with 10 credits (default)
- Every workflow execution consumes 1 credit
- You've used all 10 credits from testing
- System blocks execution when credits = 0

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Set Unlimited Credits (Recommended for Development)

**Using Prisma Studio:**
1. Run: `npx prisma studio`
2. Open User table
3. Find your user: `user_2yB5oJhNIQvPz9Yw2aIgylFB4E9`
4. Change `credits` field from `0` to `Unlimited`
5. Save changes

**Using Database Query:**
```sql
UPDATE "User" 
SET credits = 'Unlimited' 
WHERE "clerkId" = 'user_2yB5oJhNIQvPz9Yw2aIgylFB4E9';
```

### Option 2: Add More Credits
Set a high number for testing:
```sql
UPDATE "User" 
SET credits = '1000' 
WHERE "clerkId" = 'user_2yB5oJhNIQvPz9Yw2aIgylFB4E9';
```

### Option 3: Temporarily Disable Credit Check
For development only, comment out the credit check:

```typescript
// Temporarily disable for development
if (true) { // was: if ((user && parseInt(user.credits!) > 0) || user?.credits == 'Unlimited') {
    console.log(`✅ User has sufficient credits, proceeding with workflow execution`)
    // ... rest of workflow execution
}
```

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Open Prisma Studio**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

2. **Navigate to User table**

3. **Find your user** (ID: `user_2yB5oJhNIQvPz9Yw2aIgylFB4E9`)

4. **Change credits field** from `0` to `Unlimited`

5. **Save changes**

6. **Test your workflow** - make a Google Drive change

## What You Should See After Fix

## Enhanced Error Handling

I've added better error handling - you'll now see this when credits are insufficient:
```
❌ User has insufficient credits (0). Workflow execution blocked.
```

## Prevention for Future

For production:
- Implement proper credit management
- Add credit purchase system
- Set up credit notifications
- Monitor credit usage

For development:
- Use `Unlimited` credits
- Or set a high number like `1000`

**The quickest fix: Use Prisma Studio to set credits to `Unlimited`**
